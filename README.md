# Finance Management System

## Application Functionality ##

The Personal Finance Manager System is designed to 
help users manage their finances effectively. Users can 
record and categorize financial transactions (based on categories like housing,
groceries), view their earnings,  budgets, and gain insights into their spending 
habits. The application provides a console-based interface for adding income,
expenses, viewing financial summaries, setting budgets, and saving/loading 
financial states.

## Target Users ##

This application is intended for individuals who want a simple and 
effective tool for managing their personal finances. It is suitable 
for anyone looking to track their income, expenses, and budgets without 
the complexity of larger financial management software.

## Project's Interest

- **Real-world Relevance**: Personal finance management is a universal concern,
and developing a tool to assist individuals aligns with real-world needs.
The ability to track and analyze financial data is valuable for anyone 
seeking better control over their financial situation.
- **Technical Challenge**: Designing a console-based application with a clear 
model-view separation, state persistence, and non-trivial classes provides
a technical challenge.
- **User Experience Consideration**: While the initial phase is console-based,
future phases can involve transitioning to a graphical user interface. 
This adds an interesting aspect of considering user experience design 
and usability as the application evolves.
